### Introducing everyone to Dark Pita
**Website link**: https://kapa-moon.github.io/dark-pita-manual/

This is the manual of the summer project I worked on. The projects' name is **Dark Pita**. This is a Chrome extension that allows users change some webstie settings and customize the interface on some commmon websites. The extension is not published yet, but if anyone's interested, we can email you the dist file to install the extension. 

### Additional Comments  
** by Riya Singh ** 

* This is a really interesting project and tackles one of the privacy and security challenges that comes with use of The Web. Many websites and online platforms we use everyday are not well-regulated, as we have seen recently with the clash of government and big tech companies, and there is not much transparency about how our information and data is stored and tracked. I think it's important for users to take action themselves and build tools such as this one which targets dark patterns so we can begin to combat this issue.*
